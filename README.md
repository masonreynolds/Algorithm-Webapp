## How to Run

To run the program, make sure you have .NET Core 3.1 installed. You can run `dotnet run` to run the program. This will implicitly run `dotnet restore` and `dotnet build` before running `dotnet run`. Keep in mind that this will create `bin/` and `obj/` directories. 
  
The easiest way to run/edit/debug this application is by using Visual Studio Code. When you open the project is VSCode, it will prompt you to add required assets to the project. This will generate a `.vscode` folder with `launch.json` and `tasks.json` files that allow one to debug the program.
